RFM Analysis

	RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) analysis is a behavior based technique used to segment customers by examining their transaction history such as:
		•	how recently a customer has purchased (recency)
		•	how often they purchase (frequency)
		•	how much the customer spends (monetary)
	It is based on the marketing axiom that 80% of your business comes from 20% of your customers. RFM analysis helps to identify customers who are more likely to respond to promotions 	by segmenting them into various categories.

Income is a significant factor in online purchasing, making wealthier individuals important prospects for online retail marketing.

Multi-channel shoppers, who shop both in-store and through catalogs, are also frequent online buyers, indicating opportunities for cross-channel promotions.

Parents and those with basic education or older age are less likely to shop online, which can inform more targeted marketing strategies aimed at boosting online engagement within these segments.
