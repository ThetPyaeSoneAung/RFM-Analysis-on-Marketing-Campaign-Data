RFM Analysis

	RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) analysis is a behavior based technique used to segment customers by examining their transaction history such as:
		•	how recently a customer has purchased (recency)
		•	how often they purchase (frequency)
		•	how much the customer spends (monetary)
	It is based on the marketing axiom that 80% of your business comes from 20% of your customers. RFM analysis helps to identify customers who are more likely to respond to promotions 	by segmenting them into various categories.
